‚ôªÔ∏è REFACTOR: Move from CSS to SCSS:
Under the hood, sphinx-panels now utilises CSS compiled from source SCSS,
allowing for a better development environment.
The CSS files are also "hashed", to ensure that documentation using sphinx-panels will not show
old, cached CSS stylings after future updates to sphinx-panels.
